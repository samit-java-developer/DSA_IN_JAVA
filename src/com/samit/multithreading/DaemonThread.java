//Key Points
//Daemon thread (t1)
//
//JVM does not wait for daemon threads to finish once all user (non-daemon) threads are done.
//
//That means if t2 (the normal thread) and main finish, the JVM kills t1 immediately, even if it hasnâ€™t completed its loop.
//
//User thread (t2)
//
//This one must finish before JVM can exit.
//
//JVM will keep running until t2 completes.
//
//        Main thread (main)
//
//Just prints "Main done" and finishes.
//
//        After that, only t1 (daemon) and t2 (user) are running.
